#### This Repository focuses on Sockets in Java
- First is the Implementation of sockets in a `TCP` connection
- Second, Implementation of sockets in a `UDP` connection
- Third, we'll create the RMI(**Remote Method Invocation**) 
- Fourth, we'll create a simple chat application using sockets

#### What is a Socket?
- A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to.

#### What is TCP?
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other.

#### What is UDP?
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is an alternative communications protocol to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) used primarily for establishing low-latency and loss tolerating connections between applications on the internet.

#### What is RMI?
- RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a Java API that performs the object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls (RPC), with support for direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed garbage-collection.

#### What is a Chat Application?

- A chat application is a software that allows users to communicate in real-time. This application is a simple chat application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time.
